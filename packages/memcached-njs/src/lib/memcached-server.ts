  // Error strings
  // -------------
  // Each command sent by a client may be answered with an error string
  // from the server. These error strings come in three types:

  // - "ERROR\r\n"

  //   means the client sent a nonexistent command name.

  // - "CLIENT_ERROR <error>\r\n"

  //   means some sort of client error in the input line, i.e. the input
  //   doesn't conform to the protocol in some way. <error> is a
  //   human-readable error string.

  // - "SERVER_ERROR <error>\r\n"

  //   means some sort of server error prevents the server from carrying
  //   out the command. <error> is a human-readable error string. In cases
  //   of severe server errors, which make it impossible to continue
  //   serving the client (this shouldn't normally happen), the server will
  //   close the connection after sending the error line. This is the only
  //   case in which the server closes a connection to a client.

  // Storage commands
  // ----------------

  // First, the client sends a command line which looks like this:

  // <command name> <key> <flags> <exptime> <bytes> [noreply]\r\n
  // cas <key> <flags> <exptime> <bytes> <cas unique> [noreply]\r\n

  // - <command name> is "set", "add", "replace", "append" or "prepend"

  //   "cas" is a check and set operation which means "store this data but
  //   only if no one else has updated since I last fetched it."

  // - <key> is the key under which the client asks to store the data

  // - <flags> is an arbitrary 16-bit unsigned integer (written out in
  //   decimal) that the server stores along with the data and sends back
  //   when the item is retrieved. Clients may use this as a bit field to
  //   store data-specific information; this field is opaque to the server.
  //   Note that in memcached 1.2.1 and higher, flags may be 32-bits, instead
  //   of 16, but you might want to restrict yourself to 16 bits for
  //   compatibility with older versions.

  // - <exptime> is expiration time. If it's 0, the item never expires
  //   (although it may be deleted from the cache to make place for other
  //   items). If it's non-zero (either Unix time or offset in seconds from
  //   current time), it is guaranteed that clients will not be able to
  //   retrieve this item after the expiration time arrives (measured by
  //   server time). If a negative value is given the item is immediately
  //   expired.

  // - <bytes> is the number of bytes in the data block to follow, *not*
  //   including the delimiting \r\n. <bytes> may be zero (in which case
  //   it's followed by an empty data block).

  // - <cas unique> is a unique 64-bit value of an existing entry.
  //   Clients should use the value returned from the "gets" command
  //   when issuing "cas" updates.

  // - "noreply" optional parameter instructs the server to not send the
  //   reply.  NOTE: if the request line is malformed, the server can't
  //   parse "noreply" option reliably.  In this case it may send the error
  //   to the client, and not reading it on the client side will break
  //   things.  Client should construct only valid requests.

  // After this line, the client sends the data block:

  // <data block>\r\n

  // - <data block> is a chunk of arbitrary 8-bit data of length <bytes>
  //   from the previous line.

  // After sending the command line and the data block the client awaits
  // the reply, which may be:

  // - "STORED\r\n", to indicate success.

  // - "NOT_STORED\r\n" to indicate the data was not stored, but not
  // because of an error. This normally means that the
  // condition for an "add" or a "replace" command wasn't met.

  // - "EXISTS\r\n" to indicate that the item you are trying to store with
  // a "cas" command has been modified since you last fetched it.

  // - "NOT_FOUND\r\n" to indicate that the item you are trying to store
  // with a "cas" command did not exist.

  // Retrieval command:
  // ------------------

  // The retrieval commands "get" and "gets" operate like this:

  // get <key>*\r\n
  // gets <key>*\r\n

  // - <key>* means one or more key strings separated by whitespace.

  // After this command, the client expects zero or more items, each of
  // which is received as a text line followed by a data block. After all
  // the items have been transmitted, the server sends the string

  // "END\r\n"

  // Each item sent by the server looks like this:

  // VALUE <key> <flags> <bytes> [<cas unique>]\r\n
  // <data block>\r\n

  // - <key> is the key for the item being sent

  // - <data block> is the data for this item.

  // that a non-existent key exists with value 0; instead, they will fail.

  // incr <key> <value> [noreply]\r\n
  // decr <key> <value> [noreply]\r\n

  // - <key> is the key of the item the client wishes to change

  // - <0> means to set the thread on standby

  // - <1> means to return pages to a global pool when there are more than 2 pages
  //   worth of free chunks in a slab class. Pages are then re-assigned back into
  //   other classes as-needed.

  // - <2> is a highly aggressive mode which causes pages to be moved every time

  // LRU Tuning
  // ----------
  // lru <tune|mode|temp_ttl> <option list>

  // - "tune" takes numeric arguments "percent hot", "percent warm",
  //   "max hot age", "max warm age factor". IE: "lru tune 10 25 3600 2.0".
  //   This would cap HOT_LRU at 10% of the cache, or tail is idle longer than
  //   3600s. WARM_LRU is up to 25% of cache, or tail is idle longer than 2x
  //   COLD_LRU.

  // - "mode" <flat|segmented>: "flat" is traditional mode. "segmented" uses
  //   HOT|WARM|COLD split. "segmented" mode requires `-o lru_maintainer` at start
  //   time. If switching from segmented to flat mode, the background thread will
  //   pull items from HOT|WARM into COLD queue.

  // - "temp_ttl" <ttl>: If TTL is less than zero, disable usage of TEMP_LRU. If
  //   zero or above, items set with a TTL lower than this will go into TEMP_LRU
  //   and be unevictable until they naturally expire or are otherwise deleted or
  //   replaced.

  // The response line could be one of:

  // - "OK" to indicate a successful update of the settings.

  // - "ERROR [message]" to indicate a failure or improper arguments.

  // LRU_Crawler
  // -----------

  //   A value of "0" disables the sleep, "1000000" (one second) is the max.

  // The response line could be one of:

  _lru_crawler_sleep(_cmdTokens: string[], _connection: MemcacheConnection): void {

  // lru_crawler tocrawl <32u>

  // - The maximum number of items to inspect in a slab class per run request. This

  //   find items to expire.

  // The response line could be one of:

  // - "OK"

  //   the crawler to start at the tail of each of these classids and run to the
  //   head. The crawler cannot be stopped or restarted until it completes the
  //   previous request.

  //   The special keyword "all" instructs it to crawl all slabs with items in
  //   them.

  // The response line could be one of:

  // - "OK" to indicate successful launch.

  // - "BUSY [message]" to indicate the crawler is already processing a request.

  // - "BADCLASS [message]" to indicate an invalid class was specified.

  //   Similar to "cachedump", but does not lock the cache and can return all
  //   items, not just 1MB worth.

  //   Lines are in "key=value key2=value2" format, with value being URI encoded
  //   (ie: %20 for a space).

  //   The exact keys available are subject to change, but will include at least:

  // Watchers
  // --------
  // watch <fetchers|mutations|evictions>

  // - Turn connection into a watcher. Options can be stacked and are
  //   space-separated. Logs will be sent to the watcher until it disconnects.

  // The response line could be one of:

  // - "OK" to indicate the watcher is ready to send logs.

  // - "ERROR [message]" something went wrong while enabling.

  // The response format is in "key=value key2=value2" format, for easy parsing.
  // Lines are prepending with "ts=" for a timestamp and "gid=" for a global ID
  // number of the log line. Given how logs are collected internally they may be
  // printed out of order. If this is important the GID may be used to put log
  // lines back in order.

  // The value of keys (and potentially other things) are "URI encoded". Since most
  // keys used conform to standard ASCII, this should have no effect. For keys with
  // less standard or binary characters, "%NN"'s are inserted to represent the
  // byte, ie: "n%2Cfoo" for "n,foo".

  // The arguments are:

  // - "fetchers": Currently emits logs every time an item is fetched internally.
  //   This means a "set" command would also emit an item_get log, as it checks for
  //   an item before replacing it. Multigets should also emit multiple lines.

  // - "mutations": Currently emits logs when an item is stored in most cases.
  //   Shows errors for most cases when items cannot be stored.

  // - "evictions": Shows some information about items as they are evicted from the
  //   cache. Useful in seeing if items being evicted were actually used, and which
  //   keys are getting removed.

  // Statistics
  // ----------
  // The command "stats" is used to query the server about statistics it
  // maintains and other internal data. It has two forms. Without
  // arguments:

  // stats\r\n

  // it causes the server to output general-purpose statistics and
  // settings, documented below.  In the other form it has some arguments:

  // stats <args>\r\n

  // Depending on <args>, various internal data is sent by the server. The
  // kinds of arguments and the data sent are not documented in this version
  // of the protocol, and are subject to change for the convenience of
  // memcache developers.

  // Upon receiving the "stats" command without arguments, the server sents
  // a number of lines which look like this:

  // STAT <name> <value>\r\n

  // The server terminates this list with the line

  // END\r\n

  cmd_stats(_cmdTokens: string[], connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    connection.send(
      [
        "STAT foo bar",
        "STAT hello world",
        `STAT connection ${connection.getId()}`,
        `STAT port ${this._port}`,
        "END",
      ].join("\r\n")
    );
    connection.send("\r\n");
  }

  // Other commands
  // --------------
  // "flush_all" is a command with an optional numeric argument. It always
  // succeeds, and the server sends "OK\r\n" in response (unless "noreply"
  // is given as the last parameter). Its effect is to invalidate all
  // existing items immediately (by default) or after the expiration
  // specified.  After invalidation none of the items will be returned in
  // response to a retrieval command (unless it's stored again under the
  // same key *after* flush_all has invalidated the items). flush_all
  // doesn't actually free all the memory taken up by existing items; that
  // will happen gradually as new items are stored. The most precise
  // definition of what flush_all does is the following: it causes all
  // items whose update time is earlier than the time at which flush_all
  // was set to be executed to be ignored for retrieval purposes.

  // The intent of flush_all with a delay, was that in a setting where you
  // have a pool of memcached servers, and you need to flush all content,
  // you have the option of not resetting all memcached servers at the
  // same time (which could e.g. cause a spike in database load with all
  // clients suddenly needing to recreate content that would otherwise
  // have been found in the memcached daemon).

  // The delay option allows you to have them reset in e.g. 10 second
  // intervals (by passing 0 to the first, 10 to the second, 20 to the
  // third, etc. etc.).

  // "cache_memlimit" is a command with a numeric argument. This allows runtime
  // adjustments of the cache memory limit. It returns "OK\r\n" or an error (unless
  // "noreply" is given as the last parameter). If the new memory limit is higher
  // than the old one, the server may start requesting more memory from the OS. If
  // the limit is lower, and slabs_reassign+automove are enabled, free memory may
  // be released back to the OS asynchronously.

  cmd_flush_all(_cmdTokens: string[], _connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    // TODO: define if needed
  }

  // "version" is a command with no arguments:

  // version\r\n

  // In response, the server sends

  // "VERSION <version>\r\n", where <version> is the version string for the
  // server.

  cmd_version(cmdTokens: string[], connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    this._reply(connection, cmdTokens, "VERSION 0.0.1");
  }

  // "verbosity" is a command with a numeric argument. It always succeeds,
  // and the server sends "OK\r\n" in response (unless "noreply" is given
  // as the last parameter). Its effect is to set the verbosity level of
  // the logging output.

  cmd_verbosity(cmdTokens: string[], connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    this._reply(connection, cmdTokens, Replies.OK);
  }

  // "quit" is a command with no arguments:

  // quit\r\n

  // Upon receiving this command, the server closes the
  // connection. However, the client may also simply close the connection
  // when it no longer needs it, without issuing this command.
  cmd_quit(_cmdTokens: string[], connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    this.end(connection);
  }

  end(connection: MemcacheConnection): void {
    connection.close();
    this._clients.delete(connection.getId());
  }

  shutdown(): void {
    this._clients.forEach((x) => {
      x.connection.close();
    });
